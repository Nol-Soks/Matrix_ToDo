# TO-DO


This is my ToDo sytem for Matrix club task .

# Impotant_Points
- modules used :

  * express
  * zod
  * mongoose
  * cors
    
- First of all , one of biggest issue in my code base is the orientation . I know I should have created different files for different routes as well and it should be more organised .    
- I also wanted to add a jsonwebtoken verification for the users but I think I over-commited .
- Also there is an issue with the updating Todo feature . I could only make it run between backend and database requests but could not implement it in the frontend .
- There are some few hooks missing as well which I could have added after reasearching about them more .
